I'm using salesforce and there I have multiple clients. It turns out that I charge to each of them a fee for the work that I do. The work that I do is regarding debt settlements, I must speak with creditors to negotiate client's debt through an offer to then later on make a settlement. If I make a settlement, i get to charge the client knowingly an agreed fee, however must clients has not been paying to me the agreed fee, why would that be even possible?
